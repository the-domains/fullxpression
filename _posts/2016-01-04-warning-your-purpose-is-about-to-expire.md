# [WARNING: Your Purpose is About to Expire ][0]

********

"Follow your purpose"

********

We've all heard the mantra by now. 

********

A non-discriminant, all-pervading cultural battlecry cemented to the psyche of anyone with an instagram feed and burning desire to escape cubicle hell.

********

It's a call to arms. 

********

A raison d'etre. 

********

A supposed right. 

********

More than just a pithy quote card sprinkled across social media... 

********

It's become a "

way of life" 

for a whole new generation of dreamers, changemakers, and lifestyle renegades refusing to fit into somebody else's box.

********

Fair enough. 

********

The movement clearly isn't without 

some

merit. 

********

But is "living your purpose" really the soul-stirring, fire burning, self-empowering credo we so blindly ascribe it to be?

********

Or is it a wolf in sheep's clothing? 

********

That's the question that transformational coach (& expression engineer), Ryan Schwartz challenges us with in his brand new treatise: 

********

[][1]

[FREE DOWNLOAD: The 7 Principles of FullXpression][1]

********

Schwartz argues that this seemingly innocent, empowering, chest-beating declaration is actually more caging than it is liberating.

********

And an open-eyed, empirical look beyond the quote card gloss, seems to support his claim. 

********

"Live Your Purpose"

********

The phrase alone presumes that you're not already doing it.

********

As if there's some mystical, fixed "thing" that you've yet to realize.

********

A birthright you've yet to claim.

********

And this supposed "shortcoming" or inner lack can actually make it more of a disempowering pursuit. 

********

Breeding a huge sense of insecurity for anyone who isn't living their "purpose" in an obvious, culturally-affirming way.

********

And rest assured... like all consumer-driven fear and insecurity, "purpose insecurity" is one that corporations and coaches are more than willing to bank on.

********

Take a look at any bestseller list, and you'll see that "Live Your Purpose" has spawned an entire industry of slick-haired gurus, self-help authors and so-called coaches more than willing to capitalize on the insecurity it breeds.

********

But before we pull out the pitchforks, Schwartz doesn't necessarily believe that there's something nefarious at play.

********

Just a faulty paradigm and enduring mistruth.

********

And as explained deeper in the 

7 Principles of FullXpression

, here's why he believes "Live Your Purpose" is due for makeover:

****[][1]****

Purpose isn't a "fixed" thing

********

When I was 6-year old, my purpose was to become a firefighter. At 11, I wanted to play pro soccer. And today... well let's just say my purpose consists of a 

dynamic, ever-expanding list of awesome

. 

********

[][1]

[So when Ryan affirms that purpose isn't a fixed thing][1]

, but a transient impulsive thrust (intermingled and inspired by present conditions)... it all of a sudden makes a ton of sense.

********

And realizing this simple truth is quite profound.

********

it instantly liberates us from this constant search for an elusive, fixed "purpose"... 

********

... and gives us permission to stop carrying around the carcass of a "purpose" long dead.

********

It's crazy how we're so willing to do that as kids (living a new "purpose" in every moment)

********

Yet as adults, we feel obliged to stay loyal to a singular fixed "purposed"... as if rejecting it would make us a quitter or a non-committed flake. 

********

But here's where that becomes a REAL problem:

********

"When you cling to a false or expired purpose, you close your eyes to your authentic expression" 

********

Much of our inner-struggle comes not from "lack of purpose" but from inauthentic expression.

********

Yet our typical remedy often consists of psychological sorbets to soothe the hunger for fulfillment, instead of a deep dive inwards to attune to the authentic expression the moment calls for.

********

It's easy to do in times of crisis.

********

Last January, Ryan suddenly woke up paralyzed in his left side. In that moment, all the "purposes" he was living prior suddenly vanished and condensed into a single thrust of expression... 

********

"Wiggle my left fucking toe"

********

Yet in times of relative ease, our authentic expression is less obvious, and 

requires practice to reliably attune to it

.

********

That practice is what Ryan calls "FullXpression". 

********

And for anyone who's ever felt pigeonholed by a purpose they've long outgrown, his take is shockingly liberating.

********

And liberation... freedom... (even from purpose itself)... 

********

Isn't that what we're all after at the end of the day?

********

The 

The 7 Principles of FullXpression 

is Schwartz's timely attempt to initiate leaders, changemakers and "purpose"-driven individuals into a healthier, more authentic pursuit of their passion.
